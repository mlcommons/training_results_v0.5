This directory contains functions for creating recurrent neural networks
and sequence-to-sequence models. Detailed instructions on how to get started
and use them are available in the
[tutorials on tensorflow.org](http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/).

Here is a short overview of what is in this directory:


File         | What's in it?
------------ | -------------
`ptb/`       | PTB language model, see the [RNN Tutorial](http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent/)
`quickdraw/` | Quick, Draw! model, see the [RNN Tutorial for Drawing Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/recurrent_quickdraw)

If you're looking for the 
[`seq2seq` tutorial code](http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq/), it lives
in [its own repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt).
