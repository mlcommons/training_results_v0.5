# 1. Problem 
This benchmark uses Mask R-CNN for object detection.

## Requirements
* [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
* [PyTorch 18.11-py3 NGC container](https://ngc.nvidia.com/registry/nvidia-pytorch)

# 2. Directions

### Steps to download and verify data
The Mask R-CNN script operates on COCO, a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.
To download and verify the dataset use following scripts:
   
    cd ~/reference/object_detection/
    ./download_dataset.sh
    ./verify_dataset.sh

This should return `PASSED`. 
To extract the dataset use:
   
    ./caffe2/extract_dataset.sh

Mask R-CNN uses pre-trained ResNet50 as a backbone. 
To download and verify the RN50 weights use:
 
    ./download_weights.sh

## Steps to launch training

### NVIDIA DGX-1 (multi node)
Launch configuration and system-specific hyperparameters for the NVIDIA DGX-1
multi node submission are in the `config_DGX1_multi.sh` script.

Steps required to launch multi node training on NVIDIA DGX-1:

```
docker build . -t mlperf-nvidia:object_detection
DATADIR=<path/to/data/dir> LOGDIR=<path/to/output/dir> DGXSYSTEM=DGX1_multi sbatch -N $DGXNNODES -t $WALLTIME run.sub

# 3. Dataset/Environment
### Publiction/Attribution.
Microsoft COCO: COmmon Objects in Context. 2017.

### Training and test data separation
Train on 2017 COCO train data set, compute mAP on 2017 COCO val data set.


# 4. Model
### Publication/Attribution

We use a version of Mask R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone. See the following papers for more background:

### Structure & Loss
Refer to [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) for the layer structure and loss function.


### Weight and bias initialization
The ResNet50 base must be loaded from the provided weights. They may be quantized.


### Optimizer
We use a SGD Momentum based optimizer with weight decay of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.9.


# 5. Quality
### Quality metric
As Mask R-CNN can provide both boxes and masks, we evaluate on both box and mask mAP.

### Quality target
Box mAP of 0.377, mask mAP of 0.339 

### Evaluation frequency
Once per epoch, 118k.

### Evaluation thoroughness
Evaluate over the entire validation set. Use the official COCO API to compute mAP.
